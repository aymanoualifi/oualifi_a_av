00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.500
A heart that's full up like a landfill

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:42.200
A job that slowly kills you

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.100
Bruises that won't heal

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.100
You look so tired, unhappy

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.400
Bring down the government

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:14.200
They don't, they don't speak for us

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.800
I'll take a quiet life

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.200
A handshake of carbon monoxide

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.700
No alarms and no surprises

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.700
No alarms and no surprises

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.000
No alarms and no surprises

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.200
Silent

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.900
Silent

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.500
This is my final fit

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.300
My final bellyache with

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.800
No alarms and no surprises

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.900
No alarms and no surprises

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.200
No alarms and no surprises, please

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.000
Such a pretty house

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.300
And such a pretty garden

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.500
No alarms and no surprises

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.500
No alarms and no surprises

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:30.300
No alarms and no surprises, please
